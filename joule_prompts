# 1) create data entities
Design a customer loyalty program application. 
Define 4 data entities: Customers, Products, Purchases and Redemptions. 
Each customer must have the following fields: name, email, 7-digit customer number, total purchase value, total reward points, total redeemed reward points. 
All fields for each customer should be integer except name and email that will be stored as string. 
Each product should have a name, description and price. 
Purchases should include the following fields: purchase value, reward points. 
All fields in Purchases must be integer. 
Redemptions must have 1 field in integer: redeemed amount. 
Each purchase and redemption will be associated to a customer. 
Each purchase will be associated to a product and is called selectedProduct.

# 2) enhance data
Enhance my sample data with meaningful data. Any phone numbers must be 10 digits long. 
All customer numbers must be 7 digits long and one customer must use the customer number 1200547. 
No fields may be empty. 
Total purchase value must be smaller than 10000 not rounded. 
Both total reward points and total redeemed reward points must not be rounded, must not be identical. and must always sum to one-tenth of the total purchase value for each customer.

# 3) add logic to entity when trigger odata creation:

### Purchase
Reward points of each purchase will be the one tenth of the purchase value. 
Each purchase value will be added to the total purchase value of the related customer. 
Each reward point will be added to the total reward points of the related customer.

### Redemption
Deduct the redemption amount from the customer's total reward points and add that to their total redeemed points.
